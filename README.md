# Hisaab - An Expense Management Andoid Application

The Andoid application was built for the **Digitial Ocean Hackathon named CloudHack** held at Delhi on 26th November 2016.
The application aims to provide the user the option to manage his/her transactions done in multiple groups and then calculate the net amount he/she has to get or give to the person added in the same group.
It aims at minimizing the number of transactions that are made so as to reduce the hassle of exchanging money in real life.

The Algrorithm to calculate the minimum number of transactions required is an **NP Hard Problem**, and thus implemented on the DigitalOcean Cloud so as to gain more computation power.
The server side API is written in Node.js and it also incorporates the feature of creating additional droplets dynamically when the server load increases a permisiible limit.
